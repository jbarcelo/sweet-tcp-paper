% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/

\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsfonts}




% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.

\usepackage{psfrag}



% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}

%\boldmath
The transfer control protocol is designed to fill the \emph{pipe} between the source and the destination for an efficient use of network resources.
As a side effect, TCP also fills in the bottleneck buffer, which is the buffer that precedes the slowest link in the path.
Permanently filling the buffer does not offer any performance advantage.
On the contrary, permanently full buffers impair the operation of TCP causing excessive delays and timeouts.
This problem is known in the literature as bufferbloat.
In this paper, we make use of some of the insights developed by the community around the bufferbloat problem to propose a TCP congestion avoidance protocol that fills in the pipe but not the buffer.
By continuously monitoring improvements and losses in terms of throughput and delay, Sweet TCP finds and stabilizes around the optimum operation point that simultaneously maximizes the throughput and minimizes the delay.
A simple algorithm that adjusts the contention window is proposed.
In contrast with traditional congestion avoidance behaviour, the proposed algorithm reduces the congestion window as soon as symptoms of bufferbloat are detected, and increases the congestion window as soon as the symptoms disappear.
\end{abstract}
% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the journal you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
% in the abstract anyway.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
%
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
%
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
%
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
%
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.

% \IEEEPARstart{I}{n} this paper we discuss a family of protocols that can be used for radio resource assignment in wireless networks.
% The problem of assigning resources in a distributed fashion is defined as a Decentralized Constraint Satisfaction (DCS) problem \cite{duffy2011dcs}.
% We consider a particular solver for this family of problems that works iteratively, in several rounds, to find a solution to the problem.

% The solver performs a stochastic search until it converges to a solution.
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)

\IEEEPARstart{M}{any} Internet communications use the Transfer Control Protocol (TCP).
Fig.~\ref{fig:delay-throughput-vs-flight} is a copy from \cite{gettys2011bdb} and explains the behaviour of TCP as a function of the number of packets in-flight.
The number of packets in-flight is closely related to the TCP congestion window ($CWND$) which limits the number of bytes in-flight.
If the number of packets in-flight is too low, the link is not efficiently used.
If it is too high, the packets accumulate in the buffer preceding the bottleneck link and the end-to-end delay increases.

In the figure we can observe that the behaviour of TCP presents a sweet point in which throughput is maximised and delay is minimised.
If the current operation point is to the left of the optimal, the congestion window should be increased.
If the current operation point is to the right of the optimal, the congestion window should be decreased.
We try to devise a simple mechanism that can accomplish this goal.

The assumption is that every round-trip-time (RTT) we have access to an estimation of the delay and throughput and should take a decision about whether the congestion window should be increased or decreased.
Using a single sample of delay and throughput it is difficult to decide whether TCP is operating at the left or the right of the sweet point.
Therefore the strategy is to move along the horizontal axis in the figure by increasing or decreasing the number of packets in-flight, and then decide whether we are moving in the right direction or not.

In a completely ideal situation in which the TCP behaviour was exactly as represented in the figure, an increase in throughput or a decrease in delay would mean a move in the right direction.
A decrease in throughput or an increase in delay would mean a move in the wrong direction.
In a real dynamic network, it is not realistic to expect a behaviour that exactly mimics the idealized Fig.~\ref{fig:delay-throughput-vs-flight}.
For this reason we propose an algorithm that takes into account the relative variation of both delay and throughput in an attempt to make the right decision even when the measurements are noisy.

\section{Operating in TCP's Sweet Point}

The current TCP behaviour is to increase the number of packets in-flight as long as no packet loss occurs.
Roughly speaking, the number of packets in-flight increases by one every RTT.
This means that, unless Random Early Detection is used, TCP has a tendency to fill the buffer that precedes the bottleneck link and therefore to unnecessarily increase the delay of all the flows that traverse such link.

The problem is that correctly configuring RED is not trivial.
If RED is too aggressive, TCP slows down to a point in which the link is not efficiently used.
If RED is too quiescent, the queue builds up and the delays are too high.

We propose changing the mechanism that adjusts the congestion window mechanism in the congestion avoidance phase of TCP.
Instead of blindly growing the congestion window until a packet loss occurs, we suggest to increase the congestion as long as it results in performance benefits.
In other words, assuming that TCP starts at some point to the left of the optimal, the idea is to move to the right towards the sweet point. 

While the point of operation is moved to the right by increasing the congestion window, the values of throughput and delay are monitored every RTT.
When a performance loss is detected, probably in the form of same throughput and higher delay, TCP will start decreasing the congestion window.
This is, when the sweet point has been crossed and moving to the right only increases the delay and does not offer throughput benefits, we start moving to the left.
If this decrease results in a performance gain, probably in the form of same throughput and lower delay, TCP will continue decreasing the congestion window.
It will keep decreasing it as long as this behaviour results in a performance gain.
When decreasing the window results in a performance loss, probably in the form of lower throughput and same delay, TCP will revert to increasing.
This mechanism will force TCP to operate around the sweet point where the throughput is maximum and the delay minimum.

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{figures/delay-throughput-vs-flight}
  \caption{Typical delay and throughput curves as a function of the number of packets in-flight. This number is closely related to the congestion window size $CWND$.}
  \label{fig:delay-throughput-vs-flight}
\end{figure}

The idea is to take measures of throughput and delay every RTT.
We name these measures $T_i$ and $D_i$ where $T$ stands for throughput and $D$ for delay.
The integer $i$ is an index that increases every RTT.
Note that TCP already computes an estimation of the RTT which can be used for $D_i$.
To estimate $T_i$ it would be necessary to compute the amount of acknowledged data during the RTT.

After obtaining the measures $T_i$ and $D_i$, we compute the relative variation of throughput and delay as $T_{rv}=\frac{T_i-T_{i-1}}{T_{i-1}}$ and  $D_{rv}=\frac{D_i-D_{i-1}}{D_{i-1}}$, respectively.
Finally, we measure the performance improvement as $PEIM=T_{rv}-D_{rv}$.
%By taking into account the relative variance of both delay and throughput we add some extra robustness to the system.
%If the delay increases by 1\% and the throughput by 10\%, TCP will interpret it as a good result.

Note that if the current operation point is at the left of the dashed line in Fig.~\ref{fig:delay-throughput-vs-flight} and we increase the congestion window (we move to the right), the throughput increases and the delay stays the same.
Therefore we measure a positive performance improvement.
Similarly, if the current operation point is at the right of the dashed line and we reduce the congestion window (we move to the left), the throughput stays the same and the delay decreases.
Therefore we also measure a positive performance improvement.
The performance improvement is positive whenever we move closer to the optimal operation point.
Conversely, the performance improvement is negative whenever we move away from the operation point.

We can use these properties to control whether TCP should increase or decrease the congestion window.
Basically, we should keep moving in the same direction when we measure a positive performance improvement $PEIM$ and change the direction otherwise.

The behaviour of the current TCP is $CWND_i = CWND_{i-1} + MSS$ every RTT whenever there is no packet loss.
TCP always increases $CWND$ as long as there is no packet loss.

We suggest to update $CWND$ as $CWND_i = CWND_{i-1} + STAT_i*MSS$ where $STAT_i$ stands for state and can be 1 or -1.
The $CWND$ increases when $STAT_i$ is positive and decreases when $STAT_i$ is negative.
$STAT$ keeps the same value as long as there are performance improvements, and changes its value when there is a performance loss:  $STAT_i = sign(PEIM)*STAT_{i-1}$, where $sign(\cdot)$ is the sign operator that is 1 for a positive value and -1 for a negative value .
The goal is to keep moving on the same direction along the horizontal axis of the figure while there is a performance improvement and change the direction as soon as we detect a performance loss.

The following algorithm summarizes all the steps necessary to update $CWND$.
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE Entering congestion avoidance ...
\STATE $STAT_0\gets 1$ 
\STATE Measure $T_0$ and $D_0$
\STATE $i\gets 1$ 
\STATE /* The following loop is executed once every RTT */
\WHILE{ no packet loss} 
    \STATE Measure $T_i$ and $D_i$
    \STATE Compute $T_{rv}=\frac{T_i-T_{i-1}}{T_{i-1}}$
    \STATE Compute $D_{rv}=\frac{D_i-D_{i-1}}{D_{i-1}}$
    \STATE Compute $PEIM=T_{rv}-D_{rv}$
    \STATE Compute $STAT_i = sign(PEIM)*STAT_{i-1}$
    \STATE Compute $CWND_i = CWND_{i-1} + STAT_i*MSS$ 
    \STATE $i\gets i + 1$
\ENDWHILE
\end{algorithmic}

\section{Slow Start}

The exponential growth of slow start should be maintained as long as the performance improvement stays positive.
A negative performance improvement should move TCP to congestion avoidance.

\section{Packet Loss}

Sweet TCP should react to packet loss just like current TCP implementations.
The congestion window should be halved in the case of fast recovery and TCP should move back to the slow start in case of timeout.

\section{Conclusion}

Sweet TCP increases and decreases the congestion window while in the congestion avoidance mode to try to reach the point in which the throughput is maximised and the delay is minimized.
This mechanisms avoids that bottleneck buffer is completely filled.
In order to decide when to increase or decrease the congestion window, TCP has to keep track of the delay and throughput measured every RTT.

%\label{app:incl-excl-thm}
%\label{app:theorem}
%We offer an example of the counting problem in (\ref{eq:Pij})  in which we are interested in computing the probability that exactly $delta$ among the $N$ stations succeed.

%\caption{Illustration of the counting problem}
%\label{fig:counting}
%\end{figure}
%
%To illustrate the underlying idea we will use a simple example involving $N=3$ different stations choosing among $B=4$ different slots.
%We assume that the number of stations deterministically choosing its transmission slot is $d=0$ and we are interested in computing the probability that exactly $\delta=1$ station succeeds.
%
%There are a total of $B^N=4^3$ outcomes that are represented as black dots in Fig.~\ref{fig:counting}.
%Each outcome is equally likely with probability $1/64$.
%The figure also shows three events $A_1$, $A_2$ and $A_3$.
%The first event, $A_1$ represents the outcomes in which the first station succeeds.
%Similarly, the other two events, $A_2$ and $A_3$, represent the outcomes in which station 2 and 3 succeed, respectively.
%These sets are partially overlapping.
%Note also that it is impossible that two stations succeed while the third station collides.
%
%If we want to compute the probability that exactly one station succeeds, we have to count the outcomes that belong to either $A_1$, $A_2$ or $A_3$ and are not part of the intersections.
%This is $|A_1|+|A_2|+|A_3|-2(|A_1\cap A_2|+|A_1\cap A_3|+|A_2\cap A_3|)+3(|A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3|)$.
%In our paper we will use the intermediate values
% $S(1)=P(A_1)+P(A_2)+P(A_3)$,
% $S(2)=P(A_1\cap A_2)+P(A_1\cap A_3)+P(A_2\cap A_3)$, and $S(3)=P(A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3)$.
% The probability that exactly one station succeeds is finally computed  as $S(1)-2S(2)+3S(3)$.
